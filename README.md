### Overview:
Create a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline that automatically builds and deploys a Java application to an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. This pattern uses a greeting application developed with a Spring Boot Java framework and that uses Apache Maven.

This solution will be useful to build the code for a Java application, package the application artifacts as a Docker image, security scan the image, and upload the image as a workload container on Amazon EKS and can be also used as a reference to migrate from a tightly coupled monolithic architecture to a microservices architecture. 

It also emphasizes on how to monitor and manage the entire lifecycle of a Java application, which ensures a higher level of automation and helps avoid errors or bugs and has been implemented with best DevSecOps Pipeline practices.

### High Level Architecture:

![Alt text](./architecture-diagram.jpg?raw=true "Architecture")

The diagram shows the following workflow:

1. Developer will update the Java application code in the base branch of the AWS CodeCommit repository, creating a Pull Reqeust (PR).

2. Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer automatically reviews the code as soon as a PR is submitted and does a analysis of java code as per the best practices and gives recommendations to users.

3. Once the PR is merged to base branch, a AWS CloudWatch event is created.

4. This AWS CloudWatch event triggers the AWS CodePipeline.

5. CodePipeline runs the security scan stage (continuous security).

6. CodeBuild first starts the security scan process in which Dockerfile, Kubernetes deployment Helm files are scanned using Checkov and application source code is scanned using AWS CodeGuru CLI based on incremental code changes.

7. Next, if the security scan stage is successful, the build stage(continuous integration) is triggered.

8. In the Build Stage, CodeBuild builds the artifact, packages the artifact to a Docker image, scans the image for security vulnerabilities by using Aqua Security Trivy, and stores the image in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR).

9. The vulnerabilities detected from step6 are uploaded to AWS Security Hub for further analysis by users or developers, which provides overview, recommendations, remediation steps for the vulnerabilties.

10. Emails Notifications of various phases within the AWS CodePipeline are sent to the users via Amazon SNS.

11. After the continuous integration phases are complete, CodePipeline enters the deployment phase (continuous delivery).

12. The Docker image is deployed to Amazon EKS as a container workload (pod) using Helm charts. 

13. The application pod is configured with Amazon CodeGuru Profiler Agent which will send the profiling data of the application (CPU, Heap usage, Latency) to Amazon CodeGuru Profiler which is useful for developers to understand the behaviour of the application.

└── aws-proserve-java-greeting
    ├── Chart.yaml
    ├── templates
    │   ├── NOTES.txt
    │   ├── _helpers.tpl

    │   ├── serviceaccount.yaml
    │   └── tests
    │       └── test-connection.yaml
    └── values.dev.yaml
```

5) **securityhub**: ASFF template (**AWS Security Finding Format**, part of AWS SeurityHub service). This format will be used for uploading docker image vulnerabilties details to AWS SecurityHub
```bash
securityhub
└── asff.tpl
```

**Setup Procedure:**

1) **Upload code zip to S3 Bucket**:  
   (Ensure git and python 3.x are installed in your local workstation)
- Clone the repository to your local workstation<br/>

     `git clone https://github.com/nholuongut/aws-codepipeline-devsecops-amazon-eks.git`

- Navigate to the repository and execute the commands in order as indicated below. This will create compressed version of the entire code with .zip extension(**cicdstack.zip**) and will validate the zip file too:<br/>
**Note:**  you may need to use python3 for the following command(s).

     ```bash
    cd aws-codepipeline-devsecops-amazon-eks
    python -m zipfile -c cicdstack.zip *
    python -m zipfile -t cicdstack.zip
   ```
   We have cicdstack.zip file ready and this will be used in next step.<br/>
      
- Sign in to the AWS Management Console, open the Amazon S3 console, and then create an S3 bucket.
   Create a folder in the S3 bucket. We recommend naming this folder **code**.
   Upload **cicdstack.zip** created in earlier step to the code folder in the S3 bucket.  


2) **CodeCommitECR Creation**:  
   Ensure you have previously created AWS CodeCommit and Amazon ECR and that you have retrieved the necessary parameter values. If not, you can run the CloudFormation template **cf_templates/codecommit_ecr.yaml** via AWS Console. Ensure the code in zip format is uploaded as per step 1.
   Give the parameter and their values:

   | Parameter | Description |
   |--|--|
   |CodeCommitRepositoryBranchName  |Branch-name  where  the  code  resides.  Put  it  as  main  for  default  |
   | CodeCommitRepositoryName | Preferred  Name  of  AWS  CodeCommit  repo  to  be  created |
   |CodeCommitRepositoryS3Bucket|S3  BucketName  where  the  code  zipfile  resides|
   | CodeCommitRepositoryS3BucketObjKey | code/cicdstack.zip |
   | ECRRepositoryName | Preferred  Name  of  ECR  repo  to  be  created |

3) **Setup Java CICD Pipeline**:
   
   Run the cloudformation template **cf_templates/build_deployment.yaml** and give the parameter accordingly as mentioned below. Ensure you have the required parameter values ready with you.  
   **Note:**  To retrieve your **EksWorkerNodeRoleARN**, browse to the EC2 AWS Console and select one of your EKS Worker Node.  Navigate to **Security** tab panel and  click on **IAM Role** - follow that link to the Role Summary which will have display the Node IAM role and IAM role ARN.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |--|--|
   | CodeBranchName |Branch  name  of  AWS  CodeCommit  repo,  where  your  code  resides  |
   | EKSClusterName |Name  of  your  EKS  Cluster (not EKSCluster  ID)  |
   | EKSCodeBuildAppName|in  this  case  name  of  app  helm  chart (**aws-proserve-java-greeting**)|
   | EKSWorkerNodeRoleARN | ARN  of  EKS  Worker  nodes  IAM  role |
   | EKSWorkerNodeRoleName | Name  of  the  IAM  role  assigned  to  EKS  worker  nodes |
   |EcrDockerRepository|Name  of  Amazon  ECR  repo  where  the  docker  images  of  your  code  will  be  stored|
   |EmailRecipient  | Email  Address  where  build  notifications  needs  to  be  sent |
   | EnvType | environment,  e.g:  dev (since we  have  values.dev.yaml  in  helm_charts  folder) |
   |SourceRepoName  | Name  of  AWS  CodeCommit  repo,  where  your  code  resides |
   
   The creation of the Java CICD Pipeline will automatically trigger the CodePipeline too.  
   Once the cloudformation template **cf_templates/build_deployment.yaml** executes successfully, go to Outputs tab of Java CICD CF Stack in AWS console and get the value of **EksCodeBuildkubeRoleARN** (this ARN needs to be added to configmap aws_auth of EKS cluster).   

   During Cloudformation execution, you will get a email notification to confirm subscription to SNS topic created. You can go ahead and confirm the subscription.  

4) **Enable Integration Aqua Security in AWS SecurityHub**
   
   This step is required for uploading the docker image vulnerbaility findings reported by Trivy to AWS Security Hub.
   As of today, there is no support for cloudformation for this integration, hence this process has to be done manually. 
   Navigate to AWS Security Hub in AWS Console and further navigate to Integrations. Search for Aqua Security and select **Aqua Security: Aqua Security** Integration and click on **Accept findings**


5) **Patching aws_auth confmap with EksCodeBuildkubeRoleARN received from step3**:
   
   Launch a terminal/powershell/cmd in your local workstation with aws cli installed and configured with access to EKS cluster in the AWS account.<br/>
   Login to EKS cluster:
  ```bash
  aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <EKSClusterName> --region <AWSRegion>
  ```
  Next, run the script: cf_templates/kube_aws_auth_configmap_patch.sh in this way:
  ```bash
  bash cf_templates/kube_aws_auth_configmap_patch.sh <EksCodeBuildkubeRoleARN>
  ```
  This will add the IAM RoleArn in aws_auth configmap of the EKS cluster. Ensure that you are cluster creator of that EKS when running the above script.  

6) **Deployment**: 
   
   Go to CodePipeline in AWS console, and there approve the Action 'ApprovaltoDeploy' and it will run the Deploy Phase. (Ensure step 4 is completed before you go to this step)
   Once the Deploy phase is completed, go to logs of Deploy phase and get the URL of this app to access via browser.

**Note**: 

a) Since, the scope of this solution is to provide an overview of identifying potential security vulnerabilities rather than fixing it via CICD pipeline, hence in this example, during **Build Stage** we are not actually fixing the **HIGH**, **CRTICAL** docker image vulnerabilties reported by Trivy and the pipeline passes. In real scenario, if the pipeline has to fail based on  **HIGH**, **CRTICAL** vulnerbilities reported, we need to change the value of parameter **--exit-code** to **1** instead of **0** in line 42 in file: **buildspec/buildspec.yml**

b) Docker image vulnerabilities reported via Trivy are uploaded to **AWS SecurityHub**. Navigate to **Findings** under **AWS SecurityHub** in AWS Console. Filter the findings with **State = Active** and **Product Name = Aqua Security**. This will list down the docker image vulnerabilities in AWS Security Hub.

c) It may take 15 min to an hour for vulnerabilties to appear in AWS Security Hub.

d) Similar to **Build Stage**, in the **CodeSecurityScan Stage**, we are not fixing vulnerabilities reported for Dockerfile and HelmCharts via Checkov as per lines 28-33 in file: **buildspec/buildspec_secscan.yaml** and we are passing the pipeline with option **--soft-fail** in checkov commands for scan of Dockerfile and HelmCharts directory. In real scenario, if the pipeline has to fail based on vulnerabilities reported for Dockerfile and HelmCharts, the option **--soft-fail** has to be removed, that's the only change to be done.
